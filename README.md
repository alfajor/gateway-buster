# Gateway Buster

A simple tool to fetch, parse and render NY Times article content from a pre-rendered JavaScript object. Enter a standard Times URL and script walks through object properties to pull out text content. Formatting is non-existent and some articles won't render if the object structure differs from the hardcoded default. A good waste of a few hours.

# Run Locally
